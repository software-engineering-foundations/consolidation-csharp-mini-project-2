# Mini-Project 2: Lion King Reenactment

## Setup

Install the Monogame package by running `dotnet add package MonoGame.Content.Builder.Task`.
You can also run `dotnet restore` to get all the packages you need

## Running the program

To run your program:
- Use `dotnet run` to create your `LionKing.exe` file at `./LionKing/bin/Debug/net6.0/`
- Run the executable file

## Task

Inside the `Animals` folder, set up classes for each of the characters in the `Images` folder, using the `Simba` class as an example.

Inside the `Game1.cs` file, use your classes to orchestrate a reenactment of some portion of The Lion King, or even come up with your own storyline.
